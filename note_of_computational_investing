Sharpe Ratio
>Most 'important' measure of asset performance
>How well does the return of an asset compensate the investor for the risk taken
>The higher the Sharpe ratio the better
>When comparing two assets each with the same return, higher Sharpe ratio gives more return for the same risk

>Reward/Risk=How much reward are you getting for your risk?
>metric=k * ( mean(daily_rets)/stdev(daily_rets) )
>k=sqrt(250) for daily returns
note:the 250 here stand for days in trading of the year
